How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made it easier to see the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Better able to plan for all needed features, not just the ones that seem needed at the start.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Autosave: Pro - always have backups. Con - cannot group commits into meaningful chunks.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Docs is for word processing which is typically one doc at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log shows which files were changed. Git diff drills down to the exact files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

You have a way to go back to safe space.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Android Apps.
